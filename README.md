The Canadian Wildlife Service (CWS) requires reliable estimates of the harvest of migratory game birds, including waterfowl and murres, to effectively manage populations of these hunted species. The National Harvest Survey is an annual survey of hunters who purchase Canada's mandatory migratory game bird hunting permit. We use these survey data to estimate the number of birds harvested for each species, as well as hunting activity metrics such as the number of active hunters and days spent hunting. The analytical methods used to generate these estimates have not changed since the survey was first designed in the early 1970s. Here we describe a new hierarchical Bayesian model, which replaces the series of ratio estimators that comprised the old model. We are now using this new model to generate estimates for migratory bird harvests as of the 2019-2020 hunting season, and to generate updated estimates for all earlier years. The hierarchical Bayesian model uses over-dispersed Poisson distributions to model mean hunter activity and harvest (zero inflated Poisson and zero truncated Poisson, respectively). It also includes multinomial distributions to model some key components including, variation in total harvest across periods of the hunting season, the species composition of the harvest within each of those periods, and the age and sex composition in the harvests of a given species. We estimated the parameters of the main Poisson and the multinomial distributions for each year as random effects using first-difference time-series. This time-series component allows the model to share information across years and reduces the sensitivity of the estimates to annual sampling noise. The new model estimates are generally very similar to those from the old model, particularly for the species that occur most commonly in the harvest, and so the results do not suggest any major changes to harvest management decisions and regulations. However, estimates for all species from the new model are more precise and less susceptible to annual sampling error, particularly for species that occur less commonly in the harvest (e.g., sea ducks and other species of conservation concern). This new model, with its hierarchical Bayesian framework, will also facilitate future improvements and elaborations, allowing the incorporation of prior information from the rich literature and knowledge in game bird management and biology.

![Selected examples of species harvest estimates from new and old model](Figures/Figure%203.png "Figure 3 from preprent")

Examples of zone-level estimates of the species-specific harvest for a selection of waterfowl species that range from relatively data-rich (mallard [*Anas platyrhynchos*] and Canada goose: small race [mostly *Branta hutchinsii* a]) to relatively data-poor (black scoter [*Melanitta americana*] and northern pintail [*Anas acuta*]). Estimates are included for all years from 1976-2019 from the Canadian National Harvest Survey, using the new hierarchical Bayesian model described here (darker line) and the old model that it replaces (lighter line). The semi-transparent ribbon surrounding each line represents the 95% credible/confidence interval on the estimates. The light-grey stacked dots represent the number of individual parts for each species submitted in each year (each dot represents 10 wings or tail-fans), and the grey labels indicate the lowest non-zero count of parts for a given species. Province and zone abbreviations are SK3 = Saskatchewan zone 3, MB1 = Manitoba zone 1, and NF2 = Newfoundland and Labrador zone 2. This species identification is approximate, because taxonomy and identifications from submitted parts have changed over the course of the survey.

**Note:** scripts 1, 2a and 2b all require sensitive data that cannot be shared in this public repo. These 3 initial scripts have been included so that the data-manipulation tasks are transparent, however they cannot be run. The anonymous data that are required to run the model (which are created by scripts 2a and 2b) have been included in the repo and so all other scripts 3a, 3b, 4, and 5 can be run
